# Welcome to Python

## Who am I
* Pete Alonzi
* PhD, physics
* Staff Data Scientist for the Data Science Institute
* From Chicago
* Selected hobbies: Sports, gaming, music

## Let's do something!
* logon to the rivanna portal: https://rivanna-portal.hpc.virginia.edu/pun/sys/dashboard/
* fire up a console like yesterday ``` Clusters --> >_Rivanna Shell Access ```
* type "python" then let's talk about what we see
* type ``` python ```
* what about python version 3?
* type ``` module load anaconda/5.2.0-py3.6 ```
* type ``` python ``` then let's talk about what we see
* **TAKEAWAY:** Be careful about python versions, keep an eye out as we go

# Goals for Today
1. Get python running (3 ways)
2. Get comfortable with python
3. Learn how to look up help

### A quick note
Today we are working on python. However there is some knowledge of programming that is required. Don't worry if you don't know it, please ask questions. I will do my best to answer them. And I will also do my best to indicate when something is a python specific detail and when it is a programming in general item.

## Getting Python "Anaconda" (this will take some time)
* [Windows](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#windows)
* [Mac](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos)
* terminology time
  * programming langugage vs software distribution
  * python2 vs python3

* version 1.0 1994
* version 2.0 2000
* version 3.0 2008 (not widely adopted until a few years ago)

## Anaconda Installation
* You must be careful! Let's step through the installation
* When you install you also register the application with the computer's package manager.
* For most you will run the file you downloaded. If not raise your hand.
* We are now going to install anaconda and then go on break once it is installed and opens.

# Break Break Break Break
* Pete will announce what time we resume.

## Spyder
* tour
  * text editor
  * variable explorer
  * console
  * control icons
* hotkeys
* [project details](https://docs.spyder-ide.org/projects.html)

## Outline
1. Strings and Functions
2. Data types
3. Loops
4. Logic
5. How to import (aka the most important part)
